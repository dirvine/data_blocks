//! # Data Chain
//!
//! This crate holds three modules that together allow nodes in a decentralised network to manage
//! data and history of data and nodes in a container that in itself is decentralised.
//!
//! The modules here include the ability to cryptographically lock history of data and nodes
//! in a chain. There also exists the mechnism to persist these chains over sessions along with
//! a copy of the data itself (the `ChunkStore`). Data representation is via the `Data` module.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Basic usage
//!
//! TBD
//!
//! [Github repository](https://github.com/dirvine/data_chain)
